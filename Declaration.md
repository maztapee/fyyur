Declaration:

As required by standard practices, I wish to here by make the following declaration:

That I Pius Alhassan, having accepted the terms and conditions as set by the ALX FullStack Development Training organizers, wish to submit my first project while acknowledging the use of external resources from the internet chiefly among them is a similar solution template as designed and implemented by Mahmoud Sharshar, with a github repo link: https://github.com/mahmoud-sharshar/Fyyur-Artist-Booking-Site.
Without his resources, I wouldn't have been able to figure how to implement some of the advanced, technical aspects needed in completed this project. As I am just a month old in learning Python stack for web development.

I am however, a proprietary owner of this revised submission. 

I make this declaration to uphold my vow against plagiarism as indicated by the organizers of this training.

Yours truly. Pius Alhassan
